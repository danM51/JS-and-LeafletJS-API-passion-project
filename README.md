# JS and LeafletJS API passion project
small project to practice working with APIs and variouse JS liblaries. This time, I enjoyed working with LeafLetJS and the "where is the ISS?" https://wheretheiss.at/w/developer rest API. 

**project**
Thanks to leafletJS i was able to visually map and update the point of each interval (corresponding to the possition of the station) with two data properties Longitude and latitude. 

**aim**
was to design and dedicate a simple UI that is night-mode sefe, responsive and intuitve in to the user in terms of the space stations 
current location. 

The benefit of practicing this skill, will benefit future data visual projects that require external API integration.
